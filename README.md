# GSB Mobile Menu Vite Starter

## Assignment

This assignment is to understand your thought process when solving a front-end challenge, not to evaluate your knowledge of particular technologies.

### Tools

This repository is set up with Tailwind + PostCSS + ES2015 for your convenience, but feel free to use your preferred tech stack if you feel that getting up to speed with these libraries would take too much time.

**Please use whatever you're most comfortable building websites with.**

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) / [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation)
- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) / [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs)
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [CodePen.io](https://CodePen.io)
- Whatever you want...

### Objective

Your objective is to create a mobile menu that triggers to reveal itself when clicking the site's hamburger menu button. Your mobile menu should be...

1. Mobile-first & responsive
2. Accessible
3. Cross-browser compatible
4. Designed and styled as shown in the mockups
5. Prudent use of animations and transitions
6. Account for any edge-cases a user may encounter

You may modify the existing templates in any way you see fit.

You should _only build the hamburger menu button and the associated mobile menu_. You do _not_ need to build out the rest of the website.

### Design Resources

1. Image Assets

   - Included in this repository are the design assets you'll need for this assignment in the `design-assets` folder.

   - Exported raster graphics are in `src/static/img`.

2. Fonts
   - [Asap Condensed (Google Font)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Asap+Condensed?query=condensed)

### Submission

Please ensure the final build/bundled code is operational before submitting.

Submit your code by creating a GitHub/GitLab/etc. repo with your code and email that link to us.

You may also deploy your site on a free deploy server such as Heroku, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc. if you have time.

## Project Setup

All of the scripts are the default Vite scripts. So here's what you get:

- `npm run dev`
  - Runs the local dev server.
- `npm run build`
  - Builds out all assets to `dist`.
- `npm run serve`
  - Serves a preview from the built `dist`.
